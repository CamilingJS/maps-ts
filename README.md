### Notes:
#### By convention, anytime we have a file whose sole purpose is to create and export a class we will give it a capital name
#### In Typescript, convention is that we never use export default statements -- the reason is that we never have to wonder whether or not we use curly braces to import -- we will always be using curly braces to import because of this rule
#### Of this does not apply to Third Party Modules 
### Interfaces
#### A gate keeper of sorts to a method
